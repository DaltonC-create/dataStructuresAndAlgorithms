These are the following steps of the assignment:

1. Take user input for hte number of area codes that will be randomized in hte range 100-999.
2. Insert in the hash table, making sure there are no duplicates.
3. Display the load factor and average size of the occupied BSTs.
4. Display non-empty indices of the hash table & display the BST of a user defined index.
5. Search for a user-defined area code within the range & display the sequence of nodes visited.
