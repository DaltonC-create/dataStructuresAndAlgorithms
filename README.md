Coursework for Data Structures and Algorithms I &amp; II


This repository is for the assignments I have done in Data Structures and Algorithms I & II.

Every assignment utilizes code from the book, "Data Structures & Algorithms in Java 2nd ed" by Robert Lafore.

In this class we were not allowed to use biult-in Java functions for any of the data structures.
We were allowed to use and modify the book's code for each individual data structure to find creative solutions
to each assignment.

The first semester of this course has the following topics for assignments:
1. Operations on Arrays.
2. Stacks and Queues.
3. Linked Lists.
4. Recursion.

The second semester of this course has the following topics for assignments:
1. Binary Search Trees.
2. Binary Search Trees with added rules.
3. Heaps.
