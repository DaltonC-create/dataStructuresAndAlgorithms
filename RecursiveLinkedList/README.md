This is a project implementing linked list operations using recursion.

There are three methods to be implemented.

1. A recursive void method to display a single-ended singly linked list backwards.

2. A recursive boolean returning method to check and see if a double-ended doubly linked list that stores a series of characters is a palindrome or not.

3. A recursive int returning method that computes raising a base to a power BASED ON ADDITION. This method simply executes multiplication through recursive addition.
